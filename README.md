# Landing Page

Udacity landing page project

In this project I have contributed the imformations and learnings is gathers from the Udacity course.

There is a navbar which attaches automaticly to the top as you scroll down.

And the navbar also will increase by the amount of section includes in the Landing page.

As defined I used the starter code [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019).

This project uses **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**
